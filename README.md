Repository for studies on time series analysis, modelling and interpretation focusing on energy resources and socio-economic indicators.

Great book on the subject: [Forecasting: principles and practice](https://otexts.com/fpp2/selecting-predictors.html), by Rob J Hyndman. Also, [Causality: Models, Reasoning and Inference](http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/BOOK-2K/), by Judea Perl.

**obs:** pySSA script or Singular Spectrum Analysis was taken from this repo: [aj-cloete/pySSA](https://github.com/aj-cloete/pySSA).

### Further readings:

- [Time Series Forecasting Methods - Analytics Vidhya](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2018/02/time-series-forecasting-methods/) (Blog)

Explains stochastic models (ARIMA, Holt-Winters, MA, etc)

- [An Introductory Study on Time Series Modeling and Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1302.6613.pdf) (Paper)

Not only stochastic models, but also neural networks and SVM base models. 67 pages.
